# Tools

This repo is a collection of various scripts/tools.

This repo uses directories to keep things organized. Everything can be used standalone unless the file says otherwise. You do not need to download or keep every script in a directory to use an individual script. 

## Installation

Clone the repo or download individual files. 

## Usage

Each file should have comments with instructions.
